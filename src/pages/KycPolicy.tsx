      <p>
        This document gives an overview of the standards of the "Know Your
        Customer" and "Anti-Money Laundering" policies, thereby setting our
        practices for the prevention of money-laundering activities while
        dealing with our users.
      </p>

      <p>
        The objective of AML/KYC Policy is to prevent SwapFry from being used,
        intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for
        money-laundering activities. The Policy also mandates making reasonable
        efforts to determine the true identity and beneficial ownership of
        accounts, source of funds, the nature of the customer's business, the
        reasonableness of operations in the account in relation to the
        customer's business, etc., which in turn helps us to manage its risks
        prudently.
      </p>

      <p>
        We strive to protect our customers from fraudulent and scam activities
        in the crypto assets sphere. Our in-compliance policy stance is designed
        to detect funds proven to be involved in illicit activities as well as
        to protect the funds of our customers who have fallen victim to hacks,
        ransomware and malware attacks. The toolkit at work committed to
        fighting money laundering and its implications is comprised of policy
        regulations in conjunction with recent developments in software aimed at
        tracking suspicious transactions in real-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our AML/KYC Policy, procedures, and internal controls are designed to
        ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and rules and will be
        reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies,
        procedures, and internal controls are in place, to account for both
        changes in regulations and changes in our business.
      </p>

        1. CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURE
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">1.1 Identification</h3>
      <p>
        In case a transaction is spotted by our risk scoring system as
        suspicious, the transaction will be put on hold, and we will collect the
        following information from the customers, if applicable, from any
        person, entity, or organization:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>the full name;</li>
        <li>date of birth (for an individual);</li>
        <li>
          the address, which will be a residential and business street address
          (for an individual) or a principal place of business, local office, or
          other physical location (for a person other than an individual);
        </li>
        <li>
          for an individual, a valid government-issued identification,
          evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or a
          similar safeguard, such as a driver's license or passport; and for a
          person other than an individual, documents showing the existence of
          the entity, such as certified articles of incorporation, a
          government-issued business license, a partnership agreement, or a
          trust instrument.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">
        1.2 Customers Who Provide Misleading Information
      </h3>
      <p>
        After providing the information, the customer must ensure that the
        information is true, complete, and timely updated. If there are any
        grounds for believing that any of the information customer provided is
        incorrect, false, outdated, or incomplete, we reserve the right to send
        the customer a notice to demand correction and, as the case may be,
        blacklist the existing account and terminate all or part of the services
        we provide for the said customer.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">1.3 Verifying Information</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the risk, and to the extent reasonable and practicable, we will
        proceed with the verification to the extent that we have collected all
        information needed in order to know the true identity of our customers
        by using risk-based procedures to verify and document the accuracy of
        the information we get about our customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have appointed a Third-Party service provider, namely Sum & Substance
        Ltd, which entirely complies with our Privacy Policy in respect to
        processing the personal information of our customers. Sum & Substance
        Ltd will analyze the information we obtain to determine (1) whether the
        information is sufficient to form a reasonable belief that we know the
        true identity of the customer (e.g., whether the information is logical
        or contains inconsistencies); (2) whether the documents provided by the
        customers are valid and do not appear in the Specially Designated
        Nationals and Blocked Persons List or any other lists of sanctioned
        individuals.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will verify the information within a reasonable time, depending on
        the nature of the account and risk level of transactions. We may refuse
        to complete a transaction before we have verified the information, or in
        some instances, when we need more time, we may, pending verification,
        suspend transactions under suspicion.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">1.4 Lack of Verification</h3>
      <p>
        When we cannot form a reasonable belief that we know the true identity
        of a customer, we will request additional information.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">1.5 Notice to Customers</h3>
      <p>
        We provide notice to customers that their transactions may be subject to
        AML/KYC checks. This information is stated in full detail in our Terms
        of Use, and each customer is obliged to get acquainted with these Terms
        before initiating transactions.

      <p>
        Ongoing monitoring is an essential element of effective KYC procedures.
        We have an understanding of the normal and reasonable activity of the

        that fall outside the regular pattern of activity.

        implementation of KYC guidelines. The implementation procedure covers
        proper management oversight, systems and controls, segregation of
        duties, training, and other related matters. From time to time, the
        SwapFry security team will carry on the necessary quality checks and
        file audits to ensure that the KYC policies and procedures are adhered
        to. From time to time, the SwapFry security team shall update senior
        management about issues arising during the customer acquisition process.
